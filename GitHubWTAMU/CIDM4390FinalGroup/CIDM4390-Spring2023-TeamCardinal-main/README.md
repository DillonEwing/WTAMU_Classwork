# Los Barrios de Amarillo
originally from https://github.com/mvhohmann/4390Project
## This is a website for Los Barrios de Amarillo you can register a user then when a admin assigns you a role you will have access to different subsections of the website to either create workshops as a speaker or register for events or workshops as a teahcer,student or volunteer.

## We completed the sprints that we had planned out but of course there is room for growth.

We just used the main branch for our project since we did not have much conflict with merging our commits

All EML, ERD, and Use Case Diagrams are in the "Diagrams" folder, along with the burndown chart.
